My nootropic morning / My morning routine (from a user with over 3 years experience),58,dmdsvq,Nootropics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dmdsvq/my_nootropic_morning_my_morning_routine_from_a/,88,"Today I want to give you an insight how I start my everyday life. A little to me. I have actually tried almost every nootropic, adaptogen, vitamin or anything else. I've tried myself through the whole racetam family, through TCM and Ayurvedic medicine, all sorts of peptides, Russian medicines and more exceptional ones like 9-me-bc, dihexa or others. So feel free to ask me something.

When it comes to drugs I didn't hold back and tried a lot in this area as well. All that standard stuff like, weed, speed, MDMA, cocaine but also LSD, mushrooms, DMT and a lot more. I also experimented with ketamine, benzos and research chemicals for a while.

Now to my actual topic. Yesterday evening I went to bed at about 10 o'clock and this morning my wake-up call rang at 6 o'clock. So I slept about 8 hours. I always try to get my 7-8 hours sleep.

Like every morning, I went jogging for half an hour. I just run until I can't do any more, that gives me a nice boost. After that I prepare everything in my kitchen. I divide this into four sections:

**Half a litre of water with:**

\- Creatine 5 Gram

\- MSM 4 Gram

\- lugol's iodine 5% (6.25 mg iodine)

**A cup of tea:**

\- Ginger 15-20 Gram

\- Pu-er Tea 2-3 Gram

**Smothie: (I like it green)**

\- Spinach one hand

\- Banana 1x

\- frozen blueberries powder 10 gram = 100 grams blueberries (for anthocyanidins)

\- Spirulina Powder 5 Gram

\- Chlorella Powder 5 Gram

\- Matcha Powder 1 Gram

\- Maca 5 Gram

\- A mix powder of nettle, moringa, wheatgrass, barleygrass

\- Sauerkraut (I am from Germany, here you can buy fresh sauerkraut from the factory for 1-2 ‚Ç¨) 100 g

\- Bone broth (I make myself a pot every month and freeze this one) 100 ml

\- Kefir (I make my own kefir) 500 ml

\- pure  persia saffron 100 mg

**And of course my supplements:**

* **Vitamins:**

Vitamins D + K 5000 ui

* **Minerals:**

Selenium 200 mcg

Zinc 15 mg

Boron 9 mg

* **Others:**

Organic Jiagoulan (make my own capsules) approx. 1500 mg

Garlic extract Kyolic 600 mg

Royal Jelly 1-2 Gram (Sublingual)

Piracetam 400 mg

Oregano Oil with 80 mg Carvacrol

As soon as I'm done, I'm going to shower. I always try to shower ice-cold. I start warm and then slowly turn down and try to hold out for at least a minute.

When I have finished taking a shower, I get ready in the bathroom, get dressed afterwards and then go back to the kitchen. I take all my things now and can start the day. At 8:15 am I leave for work.

From time to time I also take Semax and Bromantane. But they don't belong to my standard stack.

if someone is interested, these supplements I take in the **evening**:

Cordyceps (helps me sleep realy great) 1x

Magnesium Taurate 100 mg

Organic Jiagoulan (make my own capsules) approx. 1500 mg

Hemp oil 2000 mg (these are the ones without CBD)

Niacin flush 500 mg

Milk Thistle extract 500mg",1571937223.0

A week on piracetam,61,dm87o0,Nootropics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dm87o0/a_week_on_piracetam/,40,"I'm 16 and suffer from moderate ADHD. It's been diagnosed multiple times by multiple doctors, but my mom refuses to accept prescriptions for medications because she believes it's going ""fry my brain"" and ""turn me into a vegetable."" I've tried many at home remedies for it, but none worked except for microdoses of LSD. This was working well, but after a bad full trip of LSD, microdosing causes anxiety and flashbacks. I've decided to stop all psychedelic use as a teen as a result. A week ago, I took my my first dose of piracetam, 1.5g. I really didn't feel anything and I was dissapointed. However, after a week of 3 grams per day, I am noticing marked improvements in my ability to focus on tasks. I am able motivate myself to get work done more easily, and I can stay on task for longer! I've also noticed a huge improvement in my speaking and communication skills, which is not something I expected, but I'm very grateful for it!",1571904057.0

Since 2 years now i am dealing with insomnia. Lately it has gotten worse. I am not sure about the underlying issue, i have racing thoughts at night and i am sure this is the main cause.

I tried L-Theanine and Temazepam (which really helps) but i don't think sticking to benzo's would me a great idea.

Since you guys have more knowledge about certain (sleep) supplements i ask you for advice, which is greatly appreciated.

Alcohol & Racetams,6,dmewpv,Nootropics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dmewpv/alcohol_racetams/,2,"I understand that drinking alcohol whilst on racetams is not a good idea and I do not plan to do so.    

I am wondering however if you take racetams (pir/ani in this case) during the week Mon-Thurs (with a choline supplement), then drink Fri/Sat will you encounter the unwanted side effects of the combination of both?    


I read an anecdotal report saying that use of pir reduces your tolerance to drugs and alcohol even when not currently on it if you have been a regular user recently.

Essential to supplement with Vit. D -- Boron!,117,dm0mdi,Nootropics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dm0mdi/essential_to_supplement_with_vit_d_boron/,96,"I started keeping detailed notes of the supplements I used in the past year. I noticed that Vit. D worked *extremely* well--until it didn't. It was always the same thing--it would work great for a couple of weeks with ~5000-10000 IU/day daily and then it would stop working and in fact, have a negative effect; headaches, brainfog etc.  I would stop Vit. D for a while, about 30-45 days and then it would stop working again. And the cycle continues...To me, this seemed to point towards some Vit. D cofactor getting depleted that needed to be replenished. Magnesium is the most commonly recommended supplmentation w/ Vit. D. I tried Magnesium but that only made things worse. I had *extreme* anxiety with daily Mg dosage. Vitamin K is another one that's frequently recommended--that seemed to be fairly neutral as expected since I should have been getting enough Vit. K through my diet.

BUT a quick google search for Vit. D cofactors reveals that Boron is also a cofactor. I've heard very little discussion about Boron supplementation so I was skeptical about it. But it did seem worth a try--dietary sources of boron seem to be fairly rare and you have to rely on what seems like luck to ensure that you get enough of it. So I started supplementing boron (3mg/day) 2 weeks ago. And the effects of Vit. D are back! I am back to supplementing 5000-10000 IU/day, and I don't expect for the effects to stop anytime soon. I also supplement some Vit. K to be on the safe side (maybe once or twice per week)

 Obviously, this is anecdotal. Ideally, I would like to have blood tests to back it up. But if you've experienced similar things with Vit. D, it might be worth a try!",1571872057.0

Do any of you think we‚Äôre just spinning in circles?,277,dlqj7q,Nootropics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dlqj7q/do_any_of_you_think_were_just_spinning_in_circles/,146,"I just want to be real here. I‚Äôve been using different supps/noots for years, browsing this sub for years, spending thousands and thousands of dollars (as a guy in his 20‚Äôs nonetheless). It seems like a lot of us are trying to self medicate. For me, depression and anxiety is what I‚Äôm trying to conquer and I turned to supps and noots for that. Years of my time and money to find mild temporary relief. 

I constantly see different hypothesis being posted here. NAC breaking down the BBB, Nitric Oxide being neurotoxic, and countless more. Every single day it‚Äôs something new. It‚Äôs great to be curious and question things but there‚Äôs so much wild speculation here that I feel like it‚Äôs easy to walk away with wrong information. 

I understand there‚Äôs people here with conditions like TBI that may or may not actually see some benefit but I can‚Äôt help but feel the vast majority of us are just spinning our wheels and getting caught in this cycle of different substances. I can‚Äôt help but feel many of us are self medicating and looking for a cure that doesn‚Äôt exist here but we still come because maybe we‚Äôll finally find that one thing to fix us.

I know this isn‚Äôt everyone. I understand there‚Äôs a lot of really knowledge people here but as much as it sucks to hear, sometimes the most effective things are the basics we hate to hear about. Sometimes the basics aren‚Äôt enough but how much are we really doing for ourselves here? Are throwing these different substances into our bodies doing more harm than good? 

I feel as though I‚Äôve learned so much here but I can‚Äôt help but feel it‚Äôs all relatively useless.

"It's always said that GABA doesn't work on it's own because it can't pass the blood-brain barrier, but these human studies disagree.",5,dm4sl7,Nootropics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dm4sl7/its_always_said_that_gaba_doesnt_work_on_its_own/,18,"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6031986/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6031986/)

>The effects of Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on sleep and its levels in  blood after oral administration were investigated in humans. A  randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover-designed study  was conducted to evaluate the effect of GABA on sleep. Sleep was  evaluated by electroencephalography (EEG) after oral GABA  administration. GABA significantly shortened sleep latency and increased  the total non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep time. Questionnaires  showed that subjects receiving GABA realized its effects on sleep. In  addition, the blood level of GABA after administration was investigated,  and the absorption and metabolism rates of GABA were determined. GABA  was quickly absorbed, and the blood level of GABA was the highest 30 min  after oral administration, with a subsequent decrease in concentration.  As GABA strongly affected the early stage of sleep, the effect of GABA  on sleep may be connected to its levels in blood.

There were a few more studies showing GABA affecting memory and attention as well. So forget the whole GABA not crossing BBB and just realize that it does work, whether through metabolism to other molecules or an indirect effect on the nervous system, oral GABA just works.",1571889718.0
