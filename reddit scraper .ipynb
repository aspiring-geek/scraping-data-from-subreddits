      "Not for all of us; some here have legitimate conditions and have experienced life changing things from the right nootropic. I’ve had ADHD since childhood and found myself unable to continue taking Ritalin due to a post-opioid crisis trend of every single doctor in my insurance network suddenly refusing to prescribe controlled substances. Modafinil has absolutely saved my college degree. I have no doubt that I would have dropped out of school and would be a barely functioning member of society right now without it.\n",
      "There are two points I want to make. First, the term \"self-medicate\" shouldn't have any negative connotations with regard to reasonably intelligent people. It's true that the majority of people aren't capable of doing this responsibly, but there are countless people who are able to research things, read the scientific papers on which current medical practice is based, and even gain a deeper understanding of the situation than doctors themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I see these discussion forums as a place for initial research. Some may call it irresponsible, but the trials have to start somewhere. If it weren't for pioneering individuals, we'd all be drinking breast milk. No bread, no almonds, no mushrooms, etc. Some crazy human risked it all and ate a weird papery bulb and now we all have garlic. To some extent, the same is required for nootropics. An example is the current question of whether long-term racetam use is beneficial or harmful.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Lack of a sensible plan. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Wrong expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a plan you really have to step back and decide what effect you're trying to accomplish and add ONE THING at a time to evaluate it. This would have saved you thousands, I bet. Am I right?  It also would have forced you to make better decisions and you'd know better what works for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for expectations, I think people are too often looking for an effect not offered by a chemical. There is no NZT whatever. (I didnt see the movie) \n",
      "\n",
      "They are often looking for an alternative to effort instead of an augmentation to it. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I can say without a doubt that noots have had a profound impact on me. Especially if you count the LSD and mushies as noots, (which I do). \n",
      "\n",
      "It can be life changing. But it has to be done right. And almost none of us do it right.\n",
      "Yes and no. I think you make great points and I get the vibe that many are self-medicating while missing the bigger picture or doing what really needs to be done. A lot gets hyped and there are study links to show helping some aspect to mental health and cognitive abilities. Whatever issue one may have, it may not always be entirely caused by by one thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can certainly speak for myself. They have certainly helped me in many ways. Most noots aren't \"fun\" to use. There typically isn't a euphoric feeling and one turns into a super genius. They are tools and it is most noticeable when one gets to work on mentally challenging tasks or takes the right steps to get physically healthy and develop a social life.\n",
      "100%.\n",
      "\n",
      "All to often I see people here latching on to a single study, or relatively weak observations of our current understanding and people can become almost delusional with the idea that *x must help y because of study z*, or x *upregulates y and must result in z.*\n",
      "\n",
      "More often than not, people completely forget our current understanding is actually quite limited. People throw massive amounts of money into nootropics and supplements, it's a huge industry, and companies make a lot of money from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, people in our society largely prefer exchanging money for a packaged relief, and sometimes when you tell them they're throwing their money away they will double down and defend their past choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all know what we need to do to achieve optimal performance, but few people actually do it because they're looking for a boost outside of themselves.\n",
      "Time and time again, the most enthusiastic neuronauts in this sub evoke from me the thought that people expect noots to do the heavy lifting for them. For example if they're feeling unmotivated, instead of learning how to cultivate intrinsic motivation, they want a pill to take away some of the effort required to do something challenging. They get caught up in chasing that perfect cocktail, and confidently report back benefits experienced. However, much of the outstanding effects seem to be short-term, exaggerated, and attributable to placebo with the exception of pharmaceutical-level stuff like Modafinil and amphetamine. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see nearly enough emphasis on putting in effort to cultivate cognitive ability, or rewire thinking patterns, or understand from where in one's disordered thinking mental blocks arise and how to overcome them without substances. Two things would be helpful here: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. improvement of intrapersonal awareness/conscientiousness aimed at understanding one's personal psychology (why am I like this, where do my thoughts come from, and how can I interact with myself metacognitively); and \n",
      "\n",
      "2. diligent persistence in fighting through mental blocks, in much the same way a weightlifter fights through heavier and heavier lifts, until they are dissolved (effortful, self-directed mental rewiring through repeated attempts to *e.g.* improve focus and mental stamina, improve mental discipline, and reduce distractibility). These are skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such things underpin demonstrably effective therapies like Graduated Exposure in overcoming anxiety, which teaches you to be braver and how to recognise and re-appraise perceived threats; and Cognitive Behavioural in overcoming depression, which works by sort of debugging errant thinking. It takes a lot of effort and understanding to be one's own psychotherapist, however no one but you possesses the potential to know yourself so well. At the end of the day a little supplementation might help as a support, but it's not the substitute for effort people here seem to think and wish it was. You have to do your own heavy lifting. Only hard work over time pays off.\n",
      "I suspect a good portion of this sub are former drug abusers fantasizing about a safer high than benzos/stims/etc. Not that I’m judging anyone because I get it. But we should be honest about what we’re trying to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we like substances that make us feel good and often conflate that with a performance improvement (see: Adderall, or phenylpiracetam.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are other substances that probably offer the same if not better performance improvement but can’t be “felt” at all.\n",
      "\n",

      "I have become a Limitless Stable Genius.\n",
      "First of all, you have to get your baseline right as you stated, but then when you have done that you have to be observant and logical about what is doing what. If you are looking for simple boosts in mood then it shouldn't take you thousands of dollars to pull that off... for most people a decent whole food organic liquid  vitamin can vastly increase their mood. ... but that plateaus...just like everything else. So the question is what is good enough? If you are looking for life changing drugs then simply get hooked on meth or crack... and your life will drastically change more than any nootropics experience can. I personally have seen awesome results from Semax, 9MBC, Selank, and some others, but does that mean those substances completely changed things in my life and made me happy every moment of the day with perfect cognition and verbal fluency? Hardly.  I simply tackled some issues and ended up with better results in the end. I know the results are decent because I was logical and observant.\n",
      "Nootropics can't cure all your problems. That's where it feels like you're spinning your wheels. You can only cure your problems by going within and then the nootropics may be used to help you function or operate at your potential while in the healing process. It's not the end all be all. All the drugs do is change your brain chemistry so that you can reach a certain state, but the state is within you and you hold all the power.\n",
      "I think one problem is that it is really hard to be your own doctor.\n",
      "I ask this with compassion: have you looked within to identify why you might feel depressed and anxious? Have you considered that there is a reason that these feelings arise in your experience?\n",
      "I agree. I think for normal healthy people, most nootropics are not worth it, financially or otherwise. I’m a little skeptical of any user reports related to “increases in cognition”—what does that mean exactly? Is this translating to higher test scores, better performance at work? \n",
      "\n",
      "It also seems that for every up, there’s a down, and for every positive side effect, there’s a negative one. Flooding your receptors with acetylcholine Monday seems to leave you tired and unfocused on Tuesday, etc. This nootropic increases memory but decreases your motivation to do anything. Are you taking enough to fee an effect but not so much that you build a tolerance/dependency? Once you do all this experimentation, it’s almost impossible to remember what your baseline even is. \n",
      "\n",
      "For non-healthy people, I can’t comment too much, but I query whether nootropics are the answer for most. For chronic fatigue/brain fog, nutrient absorption, anemia, hypothyroidism, gut problems or other issues strike me as far my likely than something neurodegenerative. I may be speaking from my own experience however.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, my position is that it is really difficult to maintain the perfect circumstances and ultimately tease out the effects of a nootropic you might really benefit from. And I don’t think a ton of people benefit more from increased memory or a mild calming effect more than they would from reading an extra book a month. But YMMV.\n",
      "Find a stack that works for you. Then use it somes days on/some days off and you'll mostly avoid any side effects. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ya Honestly, some of us here are just polydrug addicts using different nootropics to self medicate\n",
      "I stopped taking most nootropics when I realised I was trying to solve a psychological problem chemically. The allure of it being chemical is that it takes the responsibility away from us but a lot of people here would be better seeing a therapist than trying other nootropics.\n",

      "Personally after 2 years of therapy and taking up regular yoga practice, I only take a handful of vitamins and minerals.\n",
      "And the people said, \"Amen!\" Couldn't agree with you more. Govt in our medicine cabinet is not only an invasion of privacy but practicing med without a license. Chronic pain patient here and just waiting for them to take away the one med that keeps me somewhat functioning and somewhat able to live a somewhat normal life.\n",

Humans evolved to eat a million different things. We like and even need variety. Noots help you get that without trying 100 different foods. If you can take a little pill, for example, which is an extract of a tea, instead of drinking tea 24/7, then that’s very convenient. \n",

I'm fine with self medicating, But if you are not using them to either better yourself or using the above tactics, it's your own fault you aren't getting anywhere.

He reads obscure little studies and makes some nasty drink and then seems surprised when it doesn't cure him of all his ailments and instead goes on to the next obscure random study that declares some herb a miracle cure while living with terrible habits and abusing painkillers.

      "As an additional anecdote, I have been interested in nootropics for a long time because I have had very serious sleep issues for all my life. I'd love to get super memory and all that, but really I just want to function in the day. I had a string of doctors and surgeries and cpap machines that all did nothing for me except make me broke AND tired and I was pretty much resigned to just struggling for whatever chemical bursts of energy I could inject to get by the day and be able to think long enough to do my work. That wasn't working though either and I tried finding a doctor and this one was really good. I have other issues but one big one was oversized tonsils that were literally blocking my airflow. He saw it on the first evaluation where as I have had multiple surgeries and specialists and not one said anything about it. Sometimes you really do have to just keep going until you find that one doctor/therapist/psychologist that can spot the problem and get you the help you need. A lot of people here don't have health problems and are just looking for an edge over the regular day to day, but for those of us that have been trying nootropics as a fix for something else.. there may be help out there if you keep looking.\n",

I've had a ton of different therapists and therapy modalities and I've found that experimenting with changes to increase neuroplasticity and experimenting with  hormones (oxytocin, testosterone) and adding supplements (starting with certain vitamins I found out I was defficient in) besides the regular clean diet and exercise that I had always done, has helped me and I am getting more movement in my life then I ever did with traditional established therapy/medication that everyone seems to think is THE way to getting and being better. At this point in my life if all this ends up just being a placebo effect I really don't give a fuck. I mean, I have definitely had some physiological changes that I can't imagine is a placebo. If I was so easily changed I would have gotten help from the medications that I was told would help. At one time I even had  a psychiatrist tell me that it would be better if I could believe that the medications were going to help, and I just sat there going \"if these meds were going to do something, i want it to be the meds doing it rather than just the placebo effect\".

I suffered a bad breakup a few months ago and it really tore me up. Started indulging in bad habits that left me feeling worse off. I finally talked to a doctor a few months ago and started the search for a medication that works for me. I never wanted to be that guy all drugged up but it’s coming to a point where I can’t keep living like this. Part of the reason I made this post. The first 2 meds left me feeling terrible. I tried buproprin and it helped the depression but a couple weeks in started making my anxiety much worse. My sex drive went waaaay up and even though I was more anxious I had more motivation to be social oddly enough. About 6 weeks ago I spoke to my doctor and stopped the med and she prescribed me buspar for the anxiety and the lowest dose of bupropion (75mg). I haven’t started these yet but I’m going to soon. I’m feeling hopeful. The nice thing about these two meds is that they don’t effect your sex drive, in fact these are two meds that are known to increase it substantially and I’ve read they do not cause any kind of withdrawal.

Next you have to take part in a physical assessment including a 90-min-long mock-haircut-type-appointment in a full-scale barber-shop replica with a very chatty (but *oh so lovely...!)* hairdresser who loves to make small talk while repeatedly diverting every topic back to something about her (six) children constantly asking for your opinion with very loaded questions.\n",
